## [2.9.1](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/compare/2.9.1-rc3...v2.9.1) (2016-01-14)

Following the revocation of version 2.9.0, we observed an extended "release
candidate" phase where we encouraged users to vet JSHint for undesirable
changes in behavior. During that time, we identified and resolved a number of
such regressions. This release comprises all changes from the release candidate
phase along with the improvements initially released as version 2.9.0. This
release does not itself contain any changes to the codebase. If you are
upgrading from version 2.8.0 or earlier, please refer to the
previously-published release notes for details on bug fixes and features.

## [2.9.1-rc1](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/compare/2.9.0...v2.9.1-rc1) (2015-11-12)

Version 2.9.0 was revoked shortly after its release due to a number of
regressions. Although the underlying issues have been resolved, we are
sensitive to the possibility that there may be still more; as mentioned in
2.9.0's release notes, the variable tracking system saw a significant
refactoring.

In an effort to minimize friction with a new version, we're publishing a
release candidate and requesting feedback from early adopters. Please give it a
try in your projects and let us know about any surprising behavior!

# [2.9.0](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/compare/2.8.0...v2.9.0) (2015-09-03)

This release was a long time in the making, but it may not be the most exciting
version we've published. Most of the changes are internal refactorings that
were necessary to properly fix bugs. And fix bugs we did! Special thanks go to
Luke Page, the newest addition to the JSHint team. Luke is a maintainer of [the
Less CSS project](http://lesscss.org/), and he introduced himself to use by
overhauling JSHint's variable tracking logic.

JSHint 3.0 is closer than ever. We're excited for the opportunity to break a
few things in order to make real strides forward. In fact, the hardest part
will be *limiting* ourselves (we don't want to make migrating to the new
version onerous). If you have any ideas along these lines, please submit them
on [the project's issue tracker](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues).
We'll mark them with [the label "Breaking
Change"](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/labels/Breaking%20Change), and as we
decide what's definitely "in" for 3.0, we'll add them to [the "v3.0.0"
milestone](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/milestones/v3.0.0).
